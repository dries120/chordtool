Info</br>

Chord tool is a free script for the Scripter midi plugin that ships with Logic X.</p>

It makes you able to trigger chords using single notes.</br>
18 different chord types can be chosen from with the keyswitches between G-2 and C0.</p>

For a simple demonstration, check here: https://youtu.be/PALtjuBD-TU</p>

A concept like this has more potential but the Logic X Scripter is quite limited at the moment.</p>

It is perhaps not the most elegant of code but I wrote it for a friend while reading for my dissertation.</br>
Some other version will be made in the future.</p>

These chords are supported:</br>
Major</br>
Major 7th</br>
Major 9th</br>
Minor</br>
Minor 6th</br>
Minor 7th</br>
Minor Major 7th</br>
Minor 9th</br>
Minor 11th</br>
Diminished</br>
Diminished 7</br>
Augmented</br>
